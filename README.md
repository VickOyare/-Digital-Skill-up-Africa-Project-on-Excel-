 This project is aimed at analyzing the given data in order to generate insights on products improvement, marketing strategy and customer engagement. The data was provided by Amazon company and it contains some data about products and customers.
## Project Overview:
The data was cleaned and wrangled and the cleaned data was used to answer some questions that could help generate insights that could help the company. This section was done by the pivot table and the necessary chart were used to bring out the required and the expected results
Project Overview:The data  was analyzed using the appropriate tools after cleaning, which was solely done on excel.
The data contained some unnecessary data  and those data were eliminated out of the table.
After removing the null, empty rows and unnecessary data, duplicates were combined into a single row, names of the products and categories were shortened and all these were done during cleaning and wrangling of the data.
After cleaning and wrangling the data, it was moved into the pivot table were used the analysis was done by following the expected steps as stated in the case study.
Lastly the results of the data analyzed using the pivot table were used to build the dashboard.
## Data Sources: 
Excel file provided by Digital Skill-up Africa Project Team (from Amazon company)
## Tools Used:
#### MS Excel:
For:
- Data collection
- Data Cleaning

## Data Cleaning/Preparation:
This involves the following steps:
- The table containing the data was loaded into the excel.
- Examination of the data was done and some were eliminated because they contained null, empty and unnecessary data that are not needed in the analysis.
All these were done with the help of excel functions and shortcuts.
## Expository Data Analysis:
Pivot table was used to explore the data by answering the following questions:
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
- What is the average discount percentage by product category?
- How many products are listed under each category?

- How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
- What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,
4.0, etc.)?
- What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
- What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
- How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
- How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
- Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
- Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
- Final Task: Dashboard Creation
Using your cleaned datasets and pivot outputs, build an Excel dashboard
## Data Analysis:
The Average Discount Percentage by products category is done using the pivot table by putting the category inside row and Discount Percentage inside value, and the table was display and visualized.
The same procedures were applied to all the other questions by dropping the data into their appropriate field in the pivot table and the results were displayed.
Some other activities were carried out such as sorting in other to get the expected and desired results.
After that, charts were used to visualized the results and it was used to build the report and dashboard.
## Results:
- The product with the highest average rating is Borosil Jombo 1000-watt
= 4.0967
- Product with the highest number of reviews is Amazon Basic High-speed= 853,946
Products fewer than 1,000 reviews  = 326
- Distribution of product rating 
- =5                        (3)
- <5>4                      (926)
- =4                        (181)
- <4>3                      (344)
- =3                         (4)
- <3>2                       (5)
- =2                         (1)

- Category with the product ofhighest discount is Electronic/Hometheater,TV&Video
- Product is Sony Bravia164cm(65) = 77990
